My project is a management system for film production studio. The studio operates in two areas. 

The first area is film production, which requires filming locations, a production team, and editing and filming studios.

The second area is film distribution, which involves working with distribution companies. 

The management system provides procedures and queries that provide data to the production studio. It also provides statistics on film creation.
