My project is the management of a film production studio. The studio operates in two areas.
The first area is film production, which requires filming locations, a production team, and editing and filming studios.
The second area is film distribution, which involves working with distribution companies.
The main challenges in my content world, where the database can assist in their solutions, are resource allocation and identification for film production,
as well as managing statistics related to film creation.
